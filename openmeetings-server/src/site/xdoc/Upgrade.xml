						The Text in the Administration &gt; Backup section actually just says
						it all. The backup contains users, rooms, groups and
						appointments (Invitations and Reminders are NOT included in the
						Backup and Reminders will not be send again!). The Backup contains
						also all uploaded Files and Documents and will re-import them again.

						Max Upload Size is 1000 MB.

		<section name="Upgrading OpenMeetings from command line">
			<p>
				<i>You need OpenMeetings 2.x or later to have the command line interface (CLI)
					feature available
				</i>
			</p>
			<p>
				Alternatively to the Web-Installer you can also export and import via the command line. <br/>
				<b>You should shutdown the OpenMeetings while doing CLI export or import operations</b><br />
				Cd to your OM_HOME directory, type "./admin.sh" and hit enter. You will get options available.<br />
				<br />
				A typical export would be:<br />
				<tt>./admin.sh -b -file backup_today.zip</tt><br />
				<br />
				A typical import would be:<br />
				<tt>./admin.sh -r -file backup_yesterday.zip</tt><br />
				<br />
				You can also combine the installation with a backup, that way you will create exactly the user table
				that existed in the backup.<br />
				A typical install from backup would be:<br />
				<tt>./admin.sh -i -file backup_yesterday.zip</tt><br/>
				please see <a href="CommandLineAdmin.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Command Line Admin</a> for more options
