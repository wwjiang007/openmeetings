				All language string should be localized and stored in the language
				section. You have a full featured language editor with every
				installation of OpenMeetings, check out the

				To lookup the labelids in the GUI you can simply run OpenMeetings
				client with the debug enabled. That way every text-string has the
				labelid in brackets additionally in the textfield. To start the
				client in debug mode please check "Tips and Tricks" section of

						elements by adding <tt>wicket:visible="false"</tt> attribute
					</li>

						modifying "subject" fragment in file
